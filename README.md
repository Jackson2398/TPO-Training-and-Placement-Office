# TPO Training and Placement Office

An android application that provides interface (currently dedicated to MNNIT Allahabad, can be switched to any other college) for administrator to login and manage placements and internships. It provides interface with simple UI to easily add/edit companies appearing for placements/internships in the college. The Admin can also accept/reject new user requests and manage all users registered.

New users can register from application directly. Existing users can login and edit personal information along with facility to upload image and resume. They can view current college statistics, check and apply for upcoming companies and also read/add interview experiences.

All changes made in the application are reflected back to the database through php.

The A5.rar consists of the actual android project.
The Login.rar consists of the php files.
This project was made using xampp so the Login folder is to be placed under /include/ folder in xampp directory.
The .sql file consists of the database config with few demo entries.

On trial run make sure the url of the server is updated in all places in the android application code and any changes reflected back to php files.
